## Welcome to the proposals site for GSoC 2025! ☀️

To discuss your project proposal with the us, open a PR in this repo and add a new markdown file under the `GSoC 2025` directory following [our template](GSoC-2025/application_template.md).

Please note that at this stage we will only review the project proposal (i.e. the one page outline of the planned work) to check that it is feasible. We're also happy to answer any other questions. We won't be reviewing the personal statement etc, as only you can make that as good as possible :)

❗Please note that project proposals that have not previously discussed in this repo will not be considered


### Steps 
1. Read the information and tips on the [GSoC 2025 NIU site](https://neuroinformatics.dev/get-involved/gsoc/index.html).
    - It includes links to resources to learn more about tools such as Git and the open-source development workflow. 

2. When you are ready to discuss your proposal with us, open a PR in this repo. To do this:
    - Fork this repo.
    - Clone your fork to your local machine.
    - Create a new branch for your proposal.
    - Add a new markdown file under the `GSoC-2025` directory following [our template](GSoC-2025/application_template.md) and filename format `<Package Name>:<Project Name> (<Your-Name>)`. 
    - Add content to your proposal and commit the changes regularly.
    - When you are ready, push your changes to GitHub and open a draft pull request.
    - Check all is good, and when you are ready, mark the PR as "Ready for review"

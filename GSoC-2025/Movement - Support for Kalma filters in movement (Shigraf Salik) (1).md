# Project Proposal 

## *Synopsis*

The goal of this project is to add Kalman filter support to the movement Python library to enhance its capabilities for cleaning and filtering pose estimation data. Kalman filters are powerful tools for smoothing noisy time-series data and estimating latent states such as velocity and acceleration. This project will provide a modular, extensible Kalman filter implementation that can be used to post-process tracking data, improving data quality for downstream behavioral analysis.

Initially, the Kalman filter will be used to smooth position, velocity, and acceleration time series. As a stretch goal, the implementation may also be extended to help resolve identity switches in multi-animal tracking scenariosâ€”a common challenge in pose estimation pipelines. The project will include robust testing, thorough documentation, and example use cases to ensure usability and reproducibility. The implementation may be developed from scratch or built by wrapping an existing Python library, depending on design discussions with mentors. Overall, this project aims to make movement more powerful, flexible, and user-friendly for researchers and practitioners working with animalÂ trackingÂ data.

### Implementation Plan

This project will implement a Kalman filter in movement via a KalmanSmoother class for smoothing time-series data, integrated as a modular API (e.g., movement.smooth_with_kalman()), with pytest-based tests, documentation, and a gallery example. A stretch goal will extend it to a KalmanTracker for identity switch correction in multi-animal tracking. 
Testing will be obsessive - I learned the hard way during refactoring how pose data can break in edge cases.
For full technical details, see: https://gist.github.com/ShigrafS/10ecbf75efcbe3f57672527be004d995 

### **Risk Mitigation Plan**  

The trickiest part will be avoiding numerical instabilityâ€”I once crashed a filter by underestimating covariance bounds during my EEG work. Iâ€™ll use scipy.linalgâ€™s stabilized solvers and test with intentionally noisy spirals (like kinematics.pyâ€™s worst-case examples). If this fails, pykalmanâ€™s battle-tested math can be a fallback, though Iâ€™d lose some flexibility. For identity switches, Iâ€™ll start with 2-animal crossings since PR #480â€™s refactor taught me how movement handles paired trajectories. If time runs short, Iâ€™ll document a â€˜swap_scoreâ€™ threshold for manual review

### Communication Plan
I plan to communicate with my mentors (@niksirbi, @sfmig) through weekly synchronous check-ins via video call (Zoom or Google Meet) to discuss progress, blockers, and next steps. These meetings will be scheduled at a mutually convenient time. For daily updates and asynchronous discussions, I will use the `NIU` communityâ€™s preferred platform Zulip and email to share progress reports, ask questions, and seek feedback. Iâ€™ll provide detailed updates at least twice a week, including code snippets, test results, or documentation drafts as needed. Iâ€™ll also be responsive to mentor messages within 24 hours and remain flexible for ad-hoc discussions if urgent issues arise. My goal is to maintain clear, proactive communication to ensure alignment throughout the GSoC period.

### Personal Statement

#### Past Experience
I have previously interned at a medical AI startup, where I trained models to diagnose neurological disorders such as epilepsy, where I worked on large medical datasets and EEG files to train models. There I also learnt signal processing and Cloud Computing. Apart from this, I have also worked on Text-to-Speech models and OCR models for local languages. 

#### Motivation: Why This Project?
This project aligns closely with my interests in data science and signal processing. While refactoring kinematics.py (PR #480), I realised that implementing Kalman filters would greatly enhance `Movement's` capabilities as they could directly smooth such artifacts while preserving true motion patterns I've seen in real datasets. Having previously worked in similar fields, Iâ€™m motivated by the potential impact of cleaner, more reliable tracking data on scientific research, particularly in fields like neuroscience or ecology, all the while learning from my mentors. 

#### Match: Why Me?
My familiarity with machine learning in the field of neurology, combined with a proactive learning mindset, makes me confident I can deliver both the core deliverables and the stretch goal. Iâ€™ve already demonstrated my commitment through working on the movement codebase, and Iâ€™m prepared to dive deeper into pose estimation frameworks or state-space modeling as needed. My experience with neurological data at a startup ensures I can produce high-quality, maintainable contributions that align with movementâ€™s standards.
I would also like to add, during my time at a stealth startup, I worked with biomedical signals, giving me firsthand experience with state-space filtering challenges similar to pose tracking. 

#### Availability
I have no major academic or job commitments during the GSoC period (late May to mid-August 2025) and can dedicate 175 hours per week to this project as required. I can, if required dedicate more time to ensure the projet's success. In case of minor overlaps (e.g., exams or personal events), I will plan ahead to maintain my weekly hours and inform my mentors in advance via our agreed communication channels. My schedule is flexible, allowing me to adjust work hours to accommodate mentor availability or project needs. 

---

#### GSoC Experience
Through GSoC, I hope to gain real-world experience working in a collaborative development environment, improve my design and coding skills, and contribute to an open-source ecosystem that aligns with my interests in application of machine learning and its application in neurology. Iâ€™m excited to learn from experienced mentors, refine my ability to write production-ready code, and deepen my understanding of signal processing and tracking algorithms. This project with NIUâ€™s movement is an ideal opportunity to grow as a developer while making a tangible impact on a tool used by researchers worldwide. 

I'm applying to this project because of my passion for machine learning and neuroinformatics and to get started with Open-Source Contributions.

- **Synopsis**

This project aims to update the BrainGlobe Atlas API by integrating OpenMINDS SANDS standard for neuroanatomical atlases.
Currently, atlas packaging scripts convert public atlas data to a limited standard format; by adapting these scripts to produce output compliant with OpenMINDS SANDS,
the project will enable consistent, interoperable data representations across BrainGlobe tools.
This standardization is critical for improving data accessibility and integration within the neuroinformatics community.
The deliverables include modifications to the atlas packaging Python code, adaptation of at least one packaging script to use the new functionality,
comprehensive tests, and updated documentation.
The open source community will benefit through improved data interoperability, ease of integration for new atlases,
and enhanced reproducibility in neuroanatomical research.

## Project proposal 
_Length: max 1 page_

- **Synopsis**

    Understanding every pixel in a video and tracking their motions is a fundamental task in computer vision, and of great importance to video object tracking, segmentation, action recognition, and physical world understanding. Previously solved using optical-flow, but fails during occlusion. Thats where Tracking-Any-Point (TAP) models have gained recent popularity, because of there ability to model long range point motion which can include occlusion. Any-point trackers enable detailed monitoring of animal movements and behaviors for ethological studies. The aim of this proposal is to add support of the Tracking-Any-Point in the ethology repository to enable researcher track keypoints/individuals and further facilitate analysis using a sister repository `movement`. TAP is particularly important because that will enable researchers to analyse how the animal is moving even in moving camera conditions (by subtracting relative camera motion by applying TAP on the background points). With the possibility to add all functionalities like detection, tracking, and TAP will create an uncanny under one hood repository for ethological researchers to be benefitted.


- **Implementation timeline**

    **Deliverables**:
    - Add support for SOTA track-any-point models to ethology. Current SOTA include [SPOT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06471) , [TAPTR](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.13042v1), and [Spatial tracker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04319). Depending upon the feasibility, accuracy vs inference-time trade-off

    - Napari support to interact with TAP models
        1. Drop-down for supported trackers
        2. Query modes: Grid (with customizable size) / specific query points / random query points
        3. Load videos, project the first frame, custom select the point using cursor/ X,Y coordinates.
        4. Customizable parameters for TAP models

    - Combining detection with TAP models
        Get the centroid of the detected bounding box (yolo/rt-detr/co-detr) -> Extract the coordinates of the centroid -> Apply TAP module on the coordinates -> compare how TAP models perform vs standard trackers (Bytetrack/BoT-SORT). Issues https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/ethology/issues/13 , https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/ethology/issues/12

    - Integration with any movement repository
        1. Ensure proper serialization to/from movement repo
        2. Translating keypoints & individuals to some entity in TAP model 

    I feel 30% of the efforts will go into developing the Napari plugins while the remaining 70% in the backend support and customizations.

    **Stretch goals**:
    - Benchmarking these TAP, Detection and Tracking models on dataset of interest (with ground truth)
    - Solve existing issues in ethology, some interesting ones include (not an exhaustive list):
        1. https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/ethology/issues/5 : Identity the spikes in the TAP trajectories using difference in Kalman-filter predictions vs the actual TAP trajectory
        2. https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/ethology/issues/15 : Bounding box centroid -> SAM/SAMURAI input prompt coordinates -> Video with segmentation masks on the detected objects with preserved object-id
    - Implement low-shot detectors like [ABA OSOL](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/papers/Hsieh_Aggregating_Bilateral_Attention_for_Few-Shot_Instance_Localization_WACV_2023_paper.pdf) for labeling large dataset.

- **Motivation:**

    **Why this project?**

    Ethology facilitate the application of a wide range of computer vision tasks to animal behaviour research at a single place align with my goal of AI for Impact. Any-point trackers enable detailed monitoring of animal movements and behaviors without invasive methods, preserving naturalistic observation. Having expertise in the field of multi object detection and tracking, it was a no brainer for me to contribute to `ethology` and start exploring TAP models. Possibility to add all functionalities like detection, tracking, and TAP will create an uncanny opportunities for ethological researchers to benefit from such open-source work.

    
    **How does it link with me?**

    My passion for AI for impact led me to a research role at IISc, where I tackle Bengaluru’s severe traffic congestion using multi-object tracking and UAV-based solutions. Earlier, I focused on AI for agriculture, developing a low-complexity weed recognition model published at HiPC. I also interned at Princeton’s ModECI, standardizing computational model exchanges. All these work had one common factor `AI for Impact`. Computers would take off and re-design themselves at an ever-increasing rate. When that happens, we need to ensure the computers have goals aligned with ours. Along with this, I contributed to open-source projects like Keras-CV and TARDIS in past showing my commitment for open source development. 


- **Match: why you?**

    - In my current work, I work with object detection and tracking models for UAVs to monitor traffic. I have extensively benchmarked the SOTA tracking models on metrics including HOTA, Identity, MOTA. Published a paper titled: Benchmarking Object Detection and Tracking for UAVs (proceeding under way). Moving cameras add lot of complexity in terms of trajectory analysis, which led me to explore optical-flow and TAP to cancel out camera movement from the trajectory (work in progress)
    - Experience with edge deployment, particularly nvidia jetson orin nano and RPi. We can take this project and add edge-feasibility perspective as well
    - I have worked with a very similar org previously working on neuroscience and ML intersection: ModECI, which works towards interoperability of computational models in computational neuroscience and Machine Learning, making me a perfect fit for this organization having worked with similar researchers

- **Availability**

    - Currently, I am working as a researcher at a university. I have enough time to manage both GSoC and my full time research role.
    - I was recently selected as a visiting scholar at MIT and was invited to visit the campus in first week of June for 5-6 days. If I visit, I will make sure to compensate for my efforts on the lost time.
    - Don't have any other planned events as of now, if in case something arise, will make sure to put in extra effort.

Project Proposal
Synopsis
BrainGlobe is a widely used community-driven suite of open-source Python tools for processing, analyzing, and visualizing brain imaging data. However, there is a need to improve its data visualization capabilities, making it more accessible and insightful for neuroscientists. This project aims to enhance BrainGlobe's visualization tools by adding advanced 3D plotting functionalities, interactive data exploration, and improved UI/UX for better neuroscientific interpretation. These improvements will make BrainGlobe a more powerful and user-friendly tool for the neuroscience research community.
Implementation Timeline
Week 1: Set up the development environment, explore BrainGlobe’s existing visualization tools, and define initial requirements.
Week 2-3: Develop basic 3D visualization features using Matplotlib and PyVista.
Week 4-5: Implement interactive visualization features, allowing users to manipulate brain imaging data more intuitively.
Week 6 (Mid-term): Complete more than 50% of the project; integrate newly built features into BrainGlobe’s main workflow.
Week 7-8: Optimize performance, test on large datasets, and ensure compatibility with various neuroscience data formats.
Week 9-10: Improve UI/UX, enhance documentation, and gather community feedback.
Week 11-12: Final testing, bug fixes, documentation completion, and project submission.
Total Weekly Hours: ~20-30 hours per week.

Communication Plan
I plan to communicate with my mentor through weekly stand-up meetings via video calls and daily check-ins on Zulip. I will also maintain a detailed project log on GitHub to document progress and issues.

Personal Statement
Past Experience
I have experience in Python development, data visualization, and bioinformatics. I have worked on visualization projects, including plotting graphs using biological datasets and developing interactive tools using Kivy. My past projects include working on a healthcare-related app that analyzed and displayed data interactively.

Motivation: Why This Project?
I am deeply interested in neuroscience and bioinformatics, and BrainGlobe’s focus on neuroscientific data analysis aligns with my passion. This project provides an opportunity to contribute to a widely used open-source tool, helping researchers better analyze and interpret brain imaging data.

Match: Why Me?
I have a strong background in Python and data visualization, having worked with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and OpenCV in previous projects. My experience in developing interactive applications makes me well-suited for enhancing BrainGlobe’s visualization tools.

Availability
I will be available for 30 hours per week throughout the GSoC period. I have no major commitments during this time, allowing me to dedicate focused effort to the project.

Expectations
I expect to improve my open-source development skills, collaborate with experienced mentors, and contribute to an impactful project in neuroscience research.

Other Applications
I am only applying to BrainGlobe under NIU for GSoC 2025 and will prioritize this project fully.

## Project proposal
- **Synopsis** <br/>
  The project aims to enhance datashuttle’s TUI by adding new features and exposing key functionalities from its Python API. datashuttle helps neuroscience researchers standardize data organization, improving collaboration and reproducibility. This project will introduce graphical components (buttons, drop-downs, and log displays), enable real-time UI responsiveness, and add new features like project validation and enhanced directory editing. Deliverables include an improved TUI, new functionalities, performance optimizations, tests, and documentation. The open-source community will benefit from a more powerful and user-friendly TUI, making standardized data management more accessible.
- **Implementation Timeline**


| **Phase**                  | **Week** | **Deliverables** |
|----------------------------|---------|------------------|
| **Initial Development**    | 1       | Add UI elements like drop-down lists for directory tree editing, improve responsiveness while transfer job is active. |
| **User Experience (UX)**   | 2       | Implement buttons, radio-buttons, and a log display for validation errors and transfer jobs. |
|                            | 3       | Improve user interaction flow and enhance usability of UI components. |
| **Core Functionalities**   | 4       | Enable TUI to create folders in both "raw data" and "derivatives" (top-level folders). |
|                            | 5       | Implement file/folder upload/download feature with overwrite and dry-run parameters. |
| **Midterm Evaluation**     | 6       | Review progress, complete pending tasks, and ensure all features work smoothly. |
| **Advanced Features**      | 7       | Extend full project upload/download support to include code and analysis. |
|                            | 8       | Test and refine project-wide transfers, address edge cases. |
| **Testing**                | 9       | Develop tests for newly implemented functionalities and ensure stability. |
|                            | 10      | Perform end-to-end testing, fix any remaining bugs, and finalize the test suite for reliability. |
| **Documentation**          | 11       | Write detailed documentation for all added features, update existing docs. |
| **Final Refinements**      | 12      | Bug fixes, polish UI/UX, final reviews, and submit the final project. |
| **Stretch Goals**          | -       | Additional improvements like performance optimization, custom TUI themes. |

  
## Personal statement
- **Past experience** <br/>
  I have been actively contributing to open-source projects, collaborating with organizations like Microsoft Recommenders, Aeon, Open Library, Flyte, Wagtail, Open Climate Fix, and more. One of my most memorable moments was receiving appreciation from the Microsoft Recommenders maintainer after my first PR was merged ([link](https://x.com/miguelgfierro/status/1808596073847357646)). So far, I have successfully merged more than 15 PRs in these organisations and completed [Hacktoberfest 2024](https://holopin.io/@sumana2705). Additionally, I have completed the [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/FRH15SYH6GVW) by Stanford University (Coursera), covering Supervised Learning, Advanced Learning Algorithms, and Unsupervised Learning.
  
- **Motivation: why this project?** <br/>
Ever since the GSoC organizations were announced, I had been searching for an organisation whose aim resonates with my thinking and experience. I found NIU's initiative to develop open-source software for neuroscience and machine learning truly unique, which motivated me to choose this project. As a Python programmer with a bit of frontend development knowledge, I never expected to find a project that combines both. But when I saw the Datashuttle TUI, I was amazed, this was the first time I had explored an application developed entirely for the terminal. While contributing, I faced some challenges as a beginner, but the project maintainers were incredibly helpful. Their support kept me engaged, and I became even more eager to learn about this technology.

- **Match: why you?** <br/>
I’ve contributed to various open-source projects purely out of curiosity and a passion for learning. One of my biggest strengths is discipline and taking ownership of the project. I would like to treat the project as my own, taking care of its execution, submission and future maintenance. My contributions reflect my dedication, curiosity to learn and compassion for my fellow contributors.To make more meaningful contributions, I have learnt basics of the Textual framework and developed an introductory [project using textual](https://github.com/sumana-2705/Stopwatch). It has helped me understand the codebase deeply and contribute more effectively. I love learning from experienced people and constantly pushing myself to grow which makes me unique from others for this project. This same mindset of discipline, ownership, and continuous learning has been a defining factor in my academic journey as well. I have prepared for and cleared JEE Advanced, one of the world's toughest exams with an acceptance rate of just 1%, through self-study during the COVID lockdown. This achievement earned me a seat at IIT (BHU), one of India’s top-10 engineering institutions. It was a challenging journey, but my dedication and consistency over two years helped me succeed. I bring that same commitment, sincerity, and hard work to everything I do.

- **Availability** <br/>
  I do not have any other commitments during the program, I did not accept any Internship or other offers for the summer. I would be available for the whole program period. My University’s End Semester exams are scheduled from 25th April to 10th May, So I will be available for the whole program period. After this I will be having my Mid Semester Exams scheduled in September, that will also not take too much of my time due to less syllabus in Mid Sems. On an average, I will be available for 20-25 hours a week for the entire period. I am ready to extend this whenever needed.

## GSoC
- **GSoC experience** <br/>
  I hope to gain hands-on experience in building Terminal User Interfaces and further improve my proficiency in Python programming. Additionally, I am eager to explore NIU's other projects beyond Datashuttle and learn more about innovative ideas like it. I also look forward to building a collaborative and professional relationship with the people at NIU and continuing my contributions even after the program ends.
  
- **Are you also applying to projects with other organisations in GSoC 2025?** <br/>
I looked for many organisations working on various domains before concluding my search to datashuttle. I have made great connections contributing here and allocated majority of time and energy understanding the project. I also liked a project in UC-OSPO org so I may submit one proposal there too (just for the satisfaction), but I am not sure of it. I really want to work for `Extend the functionality of the Terminal User Interface` project this summer and it will be my top priority.

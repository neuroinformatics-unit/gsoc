## Project proposal

_Length: max 1 page_

- **Synopsis**

This project aims to update the BrainGlobe Atlas API by integrating OpenMINDS SANDS standard for neuroanatomical atlases.
Currently, atlas packaging scripts convert public atlas data to a limited standard format; by adapting these scripts to produce output compliant with OpenMINDS SANDS,
the project will enable consistent, interoperable data representations across BrainGlobe tools.
This standardization is critical for improving data accessibility and integration within the neuroinformatics community.
The deliverables include modifications to the atlas packaging Python code, adaptation of at least one packaging script to use the new functionality,
comprehensive tests, and updated documentation.
The open source community will benefit through improved data interoperability, ease of integration for new atlases,
and enhanced reproducibility in neuroanatomical research.

- **Implementation timeline**

    Please include the following information:
    1. A bullet point list with **minimal set of deliverables**
        - Update atlas packaging Python code to output OpenMINDS SANDS compliant files.
        - Adapt at least one existing packaging script to utilize the new functionality.
        - Develop and run unit and integration tests covering the updated functionality.
        - Update and expand documentation to reflect new usage and features.

    2. Additional **stretch goals** or "if time allows" deliverables
        - Extend support to additional packaging scripts within the BrainGlobe ecosystem.
        - Develop conversion utilities for legacy atlas data.
        - Create example notebooks and tutorials demonstrating the new capabilities.

    3. A detailed **weekly timeline**: when do you plan to do what? 
        - Please use a week as a minimal unit of time, and include any planned vacations or other commitments. 
        - This timeline could be formatted as a table. 
        - Remember to also include the number of hours per week you plan to work on the GSoC project. 
        - When estimating the required time for a task, keep in mind deliverables should include investigation/research, coding and documentation. 
        - The default schedule for GSoC is 12 weeks - see the [GSoC timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) for precise dates. 
        - Also please specify any prep work you plan to do during the "Community bonding period".
        - Usually week 1's deliverables already include some code. Week 6 marks the mid-term point, where usually more than half of the project should be completed. At the end of week 11 you may want to try to "freeze" the code and complete any remaining tests or documentation in weeks 11 and 12.

- **Communication plan**

    Please explain: how do you plan to communicate with your mentor? How often? (e.g., daily or weekly stand-ups, longer meetings..?) What communication channels will you use? (e.g., video calls, Zulip chat...?)

# DataShuttle: Cross-platform Executable Package ([Aakash Kharb])

## Abstract
DataShuttle currently requires Conda for installation, which limits accessibility for users without coding experience. This project aims to research and implement a robust solution for packaging DataShuttle as a standalone executable that works across Windows, macOS, and Linux. The solution will need to address Textual's rendering limitations in native terminals by potentially bundling a compatible terminal environment.

## Technical Details
The project will involve:
1. Researching existing solutions for packaging Python applications with Textual/TUI interfaces
2. Evaluating approaches like PyInstaller, PyOxidizer, Briefcase, or other packaging tools
3. Addressing the terminal rendering challenge (potentially by bundling a terminal)
4. Implementing CI/CD integration for automated builds
5. Creating comprehensive documentation for end-users

Key challenges:
- Textual's rendering limitations in native terminals
- Maintaining cross-platform compatibility
- Ensuring the solution is maintainable long-term

## Deliverables
1. Research report on packaging approaches for Textual applications
2. Implemented solution for cross-platform DataShuttle distribution
3. CI/CD integration for automated builds
4. Documentation for both users and maintainers
5. Testing framework for the packaged versions

## Timeline
| Period | Tasks |
|--------|-------|
| Community Bonding | Familiarize with codebase, setup dev environment, finalize research plan |
| Week 1-2 | Research packaging solutions, evaluate approaches |
| Week 3-5 | Prototype selected solution, address terminal issues |
| Week 6-7 | Implement CI/CD integration, automated builds |
| Week 8-9 | Comprehensive testing across platforms |
| Week 9-10 | Documentation, final polishing, mentor review | ðŸŽ‰

## Experience
## Experience
I have 3 years of Python experience with expertise in:
- Algorithms and logic implementation
- Machine learning and data science workflows
- Backend and frontend development
- Some Examples
    -  chickpea7.streamlit.app
    -  aakash-dbms.streamlit.app
    -  aakash-terminal.vercel.app

While I haven't specifically packaged Python applications Dockerfiles in depth, I understand the Python ecosystem well and am excited to dive deeper into packaging solutions and have been currently working with Docker and some similar projects.

## Contingency
If the initial packaging approach encounters any problems, difficulties, alternative solutions will be explored based on the initial research. The mentor will be contacted regularly to ensure progress.

## Other commitments
I have completed my exams and will be avilable enitrely during the summer and would contribute 35-40+ hours per week.

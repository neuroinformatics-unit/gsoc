## Project Proposal

### Synopsis

DataShuttle currently requires Conda for installation, which limits accessibility for non-technical users. This project aims to create a standalone, cross-platform executable package for DataShuttle that works on Windows, macOS, and Linux without requiring Conda or Python installation. The solution will address Textual's rendering limitations in native terminals by potentially bundling a compatible terminal environment.

### Deliverables

- Research report on packaging approaches for Textual applications
- Implemented solution for cross-platform DataShuttle distribution
- CI/CD integration for automated builds
- Comprehensive documentation for users and maintainers
- Testing framework for packaged versions

### Implementation Timeline

| Period          | Tasks                                                         | Hours/Week |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Community Bonding | Familiarize with codebase, setup dev environment, finalize research plan | 20         |
| Week 1-2        | Research packaging solutions (PyInstaller, PyOxidizer, Briefcase), evaluate approaches | 35         |
| Week 3-5        | Prototype selected solution, address terminal rendering issues | 40         |
| Week 6-7        | Implement CI/CD integration, automated builds                 | 40         |
| Week 8-9        | Comprehensive testing across platforms                        | 40         |
| Week 10-12      | Documentation, final polishing, mentor review                 | 35         |

### Stretch Goals

- Implement auto-update functionality
- Create GUI installer for each platform
- Optimize package size and performance

### Communication Plan

- Weekly video calls with mentor for progress updates
- Daily stand-ups via Zulip chat
- Regular updates via GitHub PRs/issues
- Immediate communication for blockers via Zulip/email

## Personal Statement

### Past Experience

With 3 years of Python experience, I've worked on:

- Full-stack applications (chickpea7.streamlit.app, aakash-dbms.streamlit.app)
- Terminal applications (aakash-terminal.vercel.app)
- Machine learning and data science workflows
- Backend system design and implementation

### Motivation

I'm passionate about making technical tools more accessible. DataShuttle solves important problems in neuroinformatics, but its current installation process creates unnecessary barriers. This project aligns perfectly with my interest in developer tools and user experience.

### Why Me?

- Strong Python fundamentals and problem-solving skills
- Experience with cross-platform development challenges
- Quick learner with ability to dive into new technical areas
- Passion for creating polished end-user experiences

### Availability

- No other commitments during GSoC period
- Available 35-40+ hours per week
- No planned vacations during program

## GSoC Expectations

I hope to:

- Contribute meaningfully to open-source neuroscience tools
- Deepen my understanding of Python packaging and distribution
- Learn from experienced mentors in the field
- Build connections within the neuroinformatics community

## Other Applications

Currently only applying to NIU for GSoC 2025. Fully committed to this project.

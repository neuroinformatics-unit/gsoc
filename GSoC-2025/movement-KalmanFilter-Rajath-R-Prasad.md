## Synopsis
The Movement library aims to provide efficient methods for data cleaning and filtering. This project will introduce Kalman filters to smooth position, velocity, and acceleration time series. Additionally, a stretch goal includes fixing identity switches in multi-animal tracking data.  

By implementing these features, we enhance Movement’s capabilities for trajectory estimation and filtering, making it more versatile for research in pose estimation and tracking.

## Benefits to the Community
- Improves tracking accuracy by reducing noise in time series data.  
- Helps in multi-animal tracking by reducing identity switching errors.  
- Provides a well-documented Kalman filter implementation tailored for Movement.  
- Adds a new example to the Movement gallery, increasing adoption.  

---

## Deliverables
- A Python implementation of Kalman filters for smoothing position, velocity, and acceleration time series.  
- Implementation for identity switch correction in multi-animal tracking (stretch goal).  
- Comprehensive test cases covering the new functionality.  
- Documentation explaining the implementation and API usage.  
- An example use case in the Movement gallery demonstrating Kalman filters in action.

## Technical Approach  

### **Phase 1: Research & Planning (Weeks 1-2)**  
- Study existing Kalman filter implementations (e.g., pykalman, dynamax).  
- Understand Movement's data structures and API.  
- Explore use cases in pose estimation and identity tracking.  

### **Phase 2: Core Implementation (Weeks 3-6)**  
- Implement Kalman filter for smoothing time series.  
- Integrate the filter with Movement’s existing data pipeline.  
- Write unit tests using pytest.  

### **Phase 3: Identity Switch Correction (Stretch Goal) (Weeks 7-8)**  
- Design an approach for identity switch detection and correction.  
- Implement the solution and validate with test cases.  

### **Phase 4: Documentation & Finalization (Weeks 9-10)**  
- Write documentation and API reference.  
- Create a Movement gallery example showcasing the new feature.  
- Final testing, bug fixes, and code refinement.

## Expected Outcomes
- A well-integrated Kalman filter for Movement’s use cases.  
- Improved identity tracking for multi-animal datasets.  
- High test coverage ensuring robustness.  
- Clear documentation and practical examples for users.

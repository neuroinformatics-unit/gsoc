# Project Proposal 

## *Synopsis*

The goal of this project is to add Kalman filter support to the movement Python library to enhance its capabilities for cleaning and filtering pose estimation data. Kalman filters are powerful tools for smoothing noisy time-series data and estimating latent states such as velocity and acceleration. This project will provide a modular, extensible Kalman filter implementation that can be used to post-process tracking data, improving data quality for downstream behavioral analysis.

Initially, the Kalman filter will be used to smooth position, velocity, and acceleration time series. As a stretch goal, the implementation may also be extended to help resolve identity switches in multi-animal tracking scenariosâ€”a common challenge in pose estimation pipelines. The project will include robust testing, thorough documentation, and example use cases to ensure usability and reproducibility. The implementation may be developed from scratch or built by wrapping an existing Python library, depending on design discussions with mentors. Overall, this project aims to make movement more powerful, flexible, and user-friendly for researchers and practitioners working with animalÂ trackingÂ data.

### Implementation Plan

#### Overview
The goal of this GSoC project is to enhance the `movement` library by:
- Adding a Python implementation of a Kalman filter to smooth position, velocity, and acceleration time-series data, integrating seamlessly with `movement`â€™s existing data structures (e.g., xarray).
- Optionally extending the Kalman filter to address identity switches in multi-animal tracking data as a stretch goal.
- Providing comprehensive tests, documentation, and an example use case to ensure usability and adoption by the `movement` community.

This plan details the steps to achieve these objectives, including specific code changes, testing strategies, documentation updates, and a timeline with milestones, leveraging my commitment of 30 hours per week over the 12-week GSoC period (late May to mid-August 2025).

---

#### Step 1: Understand the Current Structure
The `movement` codebase is assumed to include:
- A core module for data handling (e.g., pose estimation time-series data, possibly as xarray datasets).
- Utilities for data processing and filtering.
- A test suite (likely using `pytest`) to validate functionality.
- Documentation and a gallery of example use cases.

**Approach:**
- Review the `movement` mission, roadmap, and contributing guide to understand its architecture.
- Identify entry points for integrating Kalman filters (e.g., data ingestion, processing pipelines).
- Study existing data formats (e.g., xarray datasets with position/velocity/acceleration time-series).
- Experiment with sample pose data to understand typical workflows.

**Details:**
- Focus on compatibility with xarray, NumPy, and pandas, as specified in the project requirements.
- Time: Pre-GSoC (15â€“20 hours self-paced) + Community Bonding (30 hours, late May 2025).

---

#### Step 2: Design and Implement Core Kalman Filter
**Objective:** Create a reusable Kalman filter for smoothing time-series data (position, velocity, acceleration).

**Approach:**
- Implement a new module (e.g., `movement/filters/kalman.py`) with a `KalmanSmoother` class:
  - Attributes: initial state, process noise covariance, measurement noise covariance.
  - Methods: `fit()` (predict/update cycle), `smooth()` (return smoothed time-series).
- Support multiple motion models (e.g., constant velocity, constant acceleration) using state-space representations.
- Use NumPy for efficient matrix operations (e.g., prediction, covariance updates).

**Notes:**
- Configurable parameters will be exposed to users for tuning (e.g., noise levels).
- Initial implementation will be tested with synthetic data (e.g., noisy 2D trajectories).

**Details:**
- Code changes: Add `kalman.py` with core algorithm based on standard Kalman filter equations.
- Time: Weeks 1â€“2 (June 2â€“15, 2025, 60 hours).

---

#### Step 3: Integrate Kalman Filter into Movement
**Objective:** Seamlessly integrate the Kalman filter with `movement`â€™s data pipeline.

**Approach:**
- Extend `movement`â€™s API:

  - Ensure input/output compatibility with existing data structures (e.g., xarray.DataArray with time, position dims).
- Handle edge cases (e.g., missing data, irregular time steps) with interpolation or warnings.

**Notes:**
- The API will be modular, allowing future extensions (e.g., other filters).
- Backward compatibility with existing workflows is ensured by making the Kalman filter optional.

**Details:**
- Code changes: Modify `movement`â€™s core module (e.g., `movement/core.py`) to include the new smoothing function.
- Time: Weeks 3â€“4 (June 16â€“29, 2025, 60 hours).

---

#### Step 4: Develop Unit Tests for Core Functionality

  - Test edge cases (e.g., missing values, noisy inputs).
  - Test integration with xarray datasets (e.g., correct dims/coords preserved).
- Create utility functions to generate synthetic pose data (e.g., noisy sinusoidal motion).

**Notes:**
- Tests will cover numerical stability (e.g., covariance matrix conditioning) and parameter sensitivity.

**Details:**
- Code changes: Add `test_kalman.py` with test cases.
- Time: Weeks 3â€“6 (June 16â€“July 13, 2025, included in 120 hours total).

---

#### Step 5: Document Core Functionality

- Create a usage guide:
  - Explain Kalman filter parameters (e.g., process noise, measurement noise).
  - Provide examples with synthetic/real data.
- Integrate into `movement`â€™s existing documentation (e.g., Sphinx docs).

**Notes:**
- Documentation will be beginner-friendly, targeting students and new contributors.

**Details:**
- Updates: `movement/docs/` and `movement/filters/kalman.py`.
- Time: Weeks 5â€“6 (June 30â€“July 13, 2025, 60 hours).

---

#### Step 6: Create Example Use Case for Gallery
**Objective:** Demonstrate the Kalman filter in a practical context.

**Approach:**
- Develop a Jupyter notebook or script for the `movement` gallery:
  - Input: Synthetic or real pose data (e.g., animal tracking time-series).
  - Process: Apply `smooth_with_kalman()` to noisy data.
  - Output: Visualizations (e.g., matplotlib plots of before/after smoothing).
- Test with mentors and refine based on feedback.

**Notes:**
- The example will highlight the filterâ€™s impact (e.g., reduced noise, smoother trajectories).

**Details:**
- Code changes: Add `examples/kalman_smoothing.ipynb` to gallery.
- Time: Weeks 5â€“6 (June 30â€“July 13, 2025, included in 60 hours).

---

#### Step 7: Implement Stretch Goalâ€”Identity Switch Correction
**Objective:** Extend the Kalman filter to fix identity switches in multi-animal tracking.

**Approach:**
- Enhance `KalmanSmoother` or create a new class (e.g., `KalmanTracker`):
  - Track multiple objects using state estimation (position, velocity).
  - Detect swaps via distance metrics or prediction errors.
  - Correct identities by reassigning based on predicted trajectories.
- Test on synthetic multi-animal data (e.g., two animals crossing paths).

**Notes:**
- Requires research into multi-object tracking (e.g., Hungarian algorithm for assignment).
- May integrate with existing pose frameworks (e.g., SLEAP outputs).

**Details:**
- Code changes: Update `movement/filters/kalman.py` or add `kalman_tracker.py`.
- Time: Weeks 7â€“10 (July 14â€“August 10, 2025, 120 hours).

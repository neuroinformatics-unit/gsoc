## *Synopsis*

The goal of this project is to add Kalman filter support to the movement Python library to enhance its capabilities for cleaning and filtering pose estimation data. Kalman filters are powerful tools for smoothing noisy time-series data and estimating latent states such as velocity and acceleration. This project will provide a modular, extensible Kalman filter implementation that can be used to post-process tracking data, improving data quality for downstream behavioral analysis.

Initially, the Kalman filter will be used to smooth position, velocity, and acceleration time series. As a stretch goal, the implementation may also be extended to help resolve identity switches in multi-animal tracking scenarios—a common challenge in pose estimation pipelines. The project will include robust testing, thorough documentation, and example use cases to ensure usability and reproducibility. The implementation may be developed from scratch or built by wrapping an existing Python library, depending on design discussions with mentors. Overall, this project aims to make movement more powerful, flexible, and user-friendly for researchers and practitioners working with animal tracking data.
